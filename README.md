## Here are my symfony projects.
 
### blog-MVC
This is a blog site that utilizes a MySQL database and employs Webpack for asset management. As a user, you have the ability to create, manage (edit and delete) your own posts, as well as report any posts that you believe should be deleted by the admin.

In the role of an admin, you have full control over user management, including the ability to delete users and modify their roles (such as switching between admin and user). You also have the authority to delete posts as necessary.

## taskM-api
This is a task tracker application with a Vue.js frontend. The app operates entirely on API requests, meaning that all interactions and data retrieval are done through the API. Once users log in, they are able to create tasks to help them remember important information.
